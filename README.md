### Project Summary

This project will showcase a digital wheel that displays Chinese New Years Zodiac animals. The user can spin the wheel by the amount of pressure they apply to the pressure plate. When the wheel is spinning it will flash a blue and white light to add to the game. After the wheel spins, it will stop on a certain animal, causing an alert to pop up, allowing the user to read about said animal. After the alert, there will be a quiz section that allows for two choices (slider input), depending on what you pick, there will be either a red or green light that goes off. This will indicate whether you got the answer right or wrong. At the end, there will be two buttons to press that let you redo the quiz or start a new spin.

### IoT Structure and Responsibilities

This section will break down the ciruit system(s) needed, server data, api endpoints, and data visualization of the project, specifying which team members are responsible for each section:

1. **Research/Front-End Design**

   - Description: Conducts research on the zodiac signs and creates/plans the design of the wheel as well as other front-end elements of the site. Assisting in creating and programming the functions on the arduino, and preparing boards, wires, etc. for the presentation. Assisting with creating the API that will pop-up trivia information each time someone lands on an animal on the wheel. Assisting in designing, the buttons, wireframes, the wheel, and other aspects of the site itself. 
   - Responsible: {Andrea Godsey}

2. **Coding the Wheel to Land on an Animal**

   - Description: Responsible for coding the wheel to spin from the pressue sensor in Arduino. The amount of pressure applied to the wheel will create the rate at which it spins. During the spin, there will be a blue and white light flashing to add to the game. When the wheel has landed on a specific zodiac sign inside the wheel, there will be a section that pops up with trivia question. I will also be responsible for the end result with the two input buttons that determine if you want to retake the quiz or start a new spin. Programming the Arduino buttons for people to exit the question, aka give up , or to try the question again if they got the answer wrong. When an option has been decided and confirmed with another button, there will be two lights (red and green) that will output depending on if you chose the right answer. If the answer is wrong there will also be an output of noise, the buzzer, to let you know you got the answer wrong as well.  With an additional quiz feature that uses a slider to make a selection between true or false answers that will also be programmed in Arduino. Finally, there will be a motor programmed to spin at the same time as the wheel on the website. 
   - Responsible: {Evan Deal}

3. **Creating the Website that populates Wheel/Front-End Design**

   - Description: Coding alerts/pages for zodiac information for each animal on the wheel. Creating the website that populates the wheel. Creating the trivia question boxes, making the button for trying the question again, true or false buttons to display the user's answer choices, displaying text information about the questions and answers. Assisting with creating the API that will pop-up trivia information each time someone lands on an animal on the wheel. Assisting in creating the functions on the arduino, and preparing boards, wires, etc. for the presentation. 
   - Responsible: {Ivy Ditzenberger}

4. **Server Data and API endpoints**
   - Description: Responsible for coding the API's that will receive and send information from the wheel and to display information for the quiz/ informational topics. Will include logic to render and other API's when necessary (ex: User information). Assisting in creating the functions on the arduino, and preparing boards, wires, etc. for the presentation. Assisting with any aspects that may have to do with the front-end of the website. 
   - Responsible: {Mychal Wood}
