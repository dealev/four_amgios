### Project Summary

This project will showcase a digital wheel that displays Chinese New Years Zodiac animals. The user can spin the wheel by the amount of pressure they apply to the pressure plate. After the wheel spins, it will stop on a certain animal, causing an alert to pop up, allowing the user to read about said animal. After the alert, there will be a quiz section that allows for two choices (slider input), depending on what you pick, there will be either a red or green light that goes off. This wil indicate whether you got the answer right or wrong. At the end, there will be two buttons to press that let you redo the quiz or start a new spin.

### IoT Structure and Responsibilities

This section will break down the ciruit system(s) needed, server data, api endpoints, and data visualization of the project, specifying which team members are responsible for each section:

1. **Research/Front-End Design**

   - Description: Conducts research on the zodiac signs and creates/plans the design of the wheel as well as other front-end elements of the site. 
   - Responsible: {Andrea Godsey}

2. **Coding the Wheel to Land on an Animal**

   - Description: Responsible for coding the wheel to spin from the [ressue sensor. The amount of pressure applied to the wheel will create the rate at which it spins. When the wheel has landed on a specific zodiac sign inside the wheel, an output device will trigger that makes a sound to confirm you landing on one. I will also be responsible for the end result with the two input buttons that determine if you want to retake the quiz or start a new spin.
   - Responsible: {Evan Deal}

3. **Coding the Pop-Up Information when a person lands on an Animal**

   - Description: Coding alerts/pages for zodiac information for each animal on the wheel. With an additional quiz feature that uses a slider to make a selection between two options. When an option has been decieded and confirmed with another button, there will be two lights (red and green) that will output depending on if you chose the right answer. If the answer is wrong there will also be an output of noise to let you know you got the answer wrong as well.  
   - Responsible: {Ivy Ditzenberger}

4. **Server Data and API endpoints**
   - Description: Responsible for coding the API's that will receive and send information from the wheel and to display information for the quiz/ informational topics. Will include logic to render and other API's when necessary (ex: User information).
   - Responsible: {Mychal Wood}
